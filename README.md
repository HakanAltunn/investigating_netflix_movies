# Netflix Movie Durations Over Time


This project investigates whether the duration of Netflix movies has been decreasing over time. To do so, a dataset of Netflix movies and their properties such as release year and duration was analyzed using Python and various data analysis libraries. The results of the analysis are presented in a Jupyter notebook and visualized using Matplotlib.
